I wanted a simple image-upload that supported API use, but when I went looking,
everything had way too much stuff for what I wanted, so I decided to build my
own.

It is not complete, nor is it thoroughly tested, but it seems to work, as viewed
by my light testing.

The curl line at the top of the file is an example of how you would use it.
